Finding interesting research questions and new research topics

The ArsMagna project aims to research, implement and validate a new mathematical theory and methodology that will lead to the automatic discovery of interesting research questions and new research topics.

Our approach is based on classifying knowledge topics according to their relevance (how important is the topic), nescience (a measure of the current understanding of that topic), which will be combined in a new mathematical metric that we refer to as
interestingness. Once existing knowledge is classified, we can identify new, reviously unconsidered and unknown interesting questions by the algebraic manipulation of known topics.

Please, refer to our book at http://www.mathematicsunknown.com for more information.
